    <h1>My love for dogs</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I really like having dogs. There is only one issue with owning a dog or someone in the household owning a dog.
        I am allergic to dogs.
    </p>

    <p> I am also allergic to a few other things as well</p>
    <ul>
         <li>Cats</li> 
         <li>Mold</li>
         <li>Grass</li>
         <li>Pollen in general</li>
         <li>Guinea Pigs</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution!</h2>
    <p>There are dogs that don't grow fur, vut instead grow hair called hypoallergenic dogs</p>

    <p>Before getting a hypoallergenic dog it would be nice to know more about them. 
        So I might spend some time on sights that tell me more about them like the one below.
